    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <article>
       <p> Hello, I'm Abby Muse. I started IMD because I am very interested in videography, photography and video editing. One of my passions I would like to peruse is content creation and by doing IMD it will help me improve my skills to hopefully make my content better and be held to a higher standard.</p>

        <p>Something about me is that I really enjoy playing videogames and I love music! Videogames are a escape for me and it is very fun to meet new people with similar interests playing the same games. I also have a passion for music and love singing, dancing and listening to all different kinds of music.</p>
